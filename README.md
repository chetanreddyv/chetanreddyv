# 👋 Hey, I'm Chetan Valluru

**AI Engineer** | Mission-Critical Agentic Systems 

I build **100% reliable, production-grade AI agents** for industries where failure isn't an option. With 6+ years of experience and a Master's in Data Science from Rutgers, I specialize in architecting agentic systems that meet the rigorous standards of **MedTech, PharmaTech, and FinTech**.

## 🏗️ What Sets Me Apart

### Mission-Critical AI Architecture
I ship **enterprise-grade agentic systems** with:
- **Deterministic reasoning pipelines** for regulated environments
- **Multi-agent orchestration** with guaranteed state consistency
- **Schema-aware retrieval** ensuring 100% accuracy in healthcare and financial contexts
- **Production observability** with full audit trails and error recovery

### Proven Track Record
- **Financial Research Platform** – Multi-agent system automating market analysis with institutional-grade accuracy
- **Healthcare AI Infrastructure** – HIPAA-compliant agentic workflows for medical logistics and patient data systems
- **Vertical AI Agents at JerseySTEM** – MCP-powered platform serving 10,000+ users with 99.9% uptime
- **GemmA.I** – On-device medical-grade vision assistant with zero-latency, privacy-first architecture
- **Taylor** – Chrome extension generating tailored resumes with LLM-powered analysis
- **Custom LLM Systems** – From chess-playing GPT models to finetuned reasoning engines
